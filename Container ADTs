CONTAINER ADTs

* a container is an abstract data type whose purpose is to hold objects of some other type
* public interface includes and default constructor and member functions
* static const indicates that the given member is not associated with an object of the class, but with the whole class itself
  * for a member value: there is a single copy of that variable in the program located in static storage
  * without static every object would have its own copy located in memory
* size_t type represents only nonnegative integers and is large enough to hold the zise of any object
* can write our own default constructor to initialize member variables
* use binary search to eliminate half the search space
