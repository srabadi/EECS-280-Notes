MANAGING DYNAMIC MEMORY

* Resource Acquisition is Initialization (RAII, scope-based resource management)
  * arrange for the constructor to allocate a resource 
  * arrange for thedestructor to release the resource ( deletes the dynamic memory that it had previously allocated so memory does not leak)
* RAII allows us the leverage automatic memory management and a class-type object to successfully manage a dyname array (or dynamic memory in general)
